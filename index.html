    <!-- 
    
    There was a time on the internet when
    you could view the source of any web-
    page and see how it was put together.

    The raw materials — HTML, CSS, and 
    sometimes Javascript — were not 
    obfuscated by modern build processes; 
    you could follow the logic, and the 
    more you saw of it, the more you 
    realised it wasn't code at all for 
    the most part, just a type of grammar.

    These workflow improvements had a 
    great effect on speed and production, 
    but in this advance, we lost the 
    ability for others to learn how the 
    web is made. Our client work makes 
    use of these advancements, but this 
    site will be kept as basic and 
    understandable as possible.
