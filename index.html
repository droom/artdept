    <!-- 
    
    There was a time on the internet when
    you could view the source of any web-
    page and see how it was put together.

    The raw materials — HTML, CSS, and 
    sometimes Javascript — were not 
    obfuscated by modern build processes; 
    you could follow the logic, and the 
    more you saw of it, the more you 
    realised it wasn't code at all for 
    the most part, just a type of grammar.

    This had a great effect on speed and 
    production, but in this advance, we 
    lost the ability for others to learn 
    how the web is made. Our client work 
    makes use of these advancements, but 
    this site will be kept as basic and 
    understandable as possible.
