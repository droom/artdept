        <h3>Union Posters</h3>
        <p>2017&ndash;2019</p>

        <p>A series of union meeting posters made for Shelter's UNITE group. For these, I limited myself to using Akzidenz Grotesk.</p>

        <h3>Portfolios</h3>
        <p>Since 1998 I've been creating portfolios to house art and design made at school or personal projects. I didn't really think about why at the time but it was mainly so I could experiment with layouts, my way into the web being graphic design interest, rather than the cmore common technical interest.</p>
        <p>These had good benefits:</p>

        <h3>Learning resources</h3>
        <ul class="list">
          <li>Markup is graphic design</li>
          <li>Make a simple website using free professional tools.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Education</h3>


        <p>I did extremely badly in formal education. I am the only person I know to have got three Us at A-level &mdash; results so poor, it almost becomes an achievement. The only thing I've to be proud in this setting is getting a Distinction in Art Foundation, mainly thanks to three teachers that could deal with an extemely difficult and emotionally troubled div.</p>
        <p>When I was 15 I asked for this book for christmas as it had a hefty price tag</p>
        <p>Learning Flash meant I got work designing Flash ads. they had a bad reputation because so many were intrusive and appaling to look at. this was my way into the industry and I don't think I would be doing this now if it wasn't for that.</p>
        <p>It is important to stress that the only reason I wanted this was to learn how these cool things were made, not for any employment reasons.</p>
        <p>If, was designers, our growth is independent of commercial considerations, we can keep that spirit of learning even when times are tough work-wise, which they invevitably will be.</p>
